## About the App

Considering going to an artist’s concert? Don’t know if it’s worth it to drop the money on a show? Introducing a concert review app! This web app will allow users to leave review’s for an artist’s live performance.

These reviews will be on the artist’s page. The user will be able to put where and when the concert took place. They will also be able to leave a little blurb of the review. Also, the user will be able to put a rating system of either 0 – 100% on how the show rocked. 100% for the most rocking show ever. From the individual reviews, there will be an overall score for the artist
There will also be a profile page to mark which shows you’ve left reviews for. You can edit your profile picture and either update or delete your own reviews.

There will be an admin login that will have the power to delete inappropriate reviews for artists.
